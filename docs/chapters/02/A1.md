  <figcaption markdown="1"><b>Figure 2.34:</b> Consider the following pictures of stuff that humanity as a species has done. One underlying backdrop of many of those scenarios is that “Intelligent agency is a mighty force for transforming the world on purpose, and Creating agents who are far more intelligent than us, is playing with fire”.

The consensus threat model among DeepMind's alignment team suggests that X-risks will most likely stem from a Misaligned Power Seeking AGI. This type of AGI seeks power as an instrumental subgoal—having more power expands the system's capabilities, thereby improving its effectiveness in achieving its primary objectives. The misalignment is anticipated to arise from a combination of Specification Gaming, where the AGI exploits loopholes in the rules or objectives it has been given, and goal misgeneralization, where the AGI applies its objectives in broader contexts than intended and can lead to deceptive alignment, where the AGI's misalignment may not be readily apparent.

Many authors have studied those kinds of stories. Here, we will present the work of Carlsmith (2022), which stands as a widely discussed, and comprehensive examination of such risks. In the following story, we will assemble many bricks that have been detailed previously in this chapter.

**Timelines: “By 2070, it will become possible and financially feasible to build Advanced Planning Strategically aware systems (APS).”** Advanced Planning Strategically aware systems are systems that have developed a high level of strategic awareness (a sub-dimension of situational awareness) and planning capability.

We won’t discuss this hypothesis, please refer to Chapter 1, or this [literature review](https://epochai.org/blog/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence-timelines).

**Incentives for APS System Development: “There will be strong incentives to build APS systems”** Advanced Planning Strategically aware systems would be useful for a wide range of tasks and may represent the most efficient pathway for development due to the current state of technological advancement. However, relying on goal-directed behavior introduces the risk of misalignment. These systems may develop unforeseen strategies to achieve goals that are not aligned with human values or intentions.

**Complexities in Achieving Alignment Instrumental Convergence Dilemma.** Instrumental convergence, as previously discussed, is a likely outcome if left unchecked, given that power is a universally beneficial resource for achieving various ends. Central to the report is the hypothesis that observed misaligned behaviors in response to certain inputs indicate potential misaligned power-seeking behaviors associated with those inputs. Therefore, any misalignment detected in contemporary systems could presage power-seeking tendencies in more advanced future systems.

**Inherent Technical Challenges.** The phenomenon of Specification Gaming is a significant concern. When systems optimize for proxies that correlate with the desired outcome, they may inadvertently disrupt this correlation. Similarly, issues arise during the search for systems that fulfill specific evaluation criteria, for example, goal misgeneralization. Meeting these criteria does not guarantee that the systems are inherently driven by them.

**The Imperfection of Existing Solutions.** Current strategies for shaping objectives, such as promoting honesty or rewarding cooperation, are still rudimentary and fraught with limitations, as detailed in the section 'Problems with RLHF'. Moreover, attempts to control capabilities through specialization or prevention of capability enhancement often conflict with economic motivations. For instance, an AI tasked with maximizing a startup's revenue will naturally gravitate towards enhancing its capabilities. Sometimes, to remain competitive, a high degree of generality is indispensable. Options for control, such as containment (boxing) or surveillance, also tend to run counter to economic drives. Collectively, all proposed solutions carry inherent problems and pose significant risks if relied upon during the scaling of capabilities.

**The Potential for Catastrophic Failures Perverse Economic Incentives.** The economic landscape surrounding the deployment of misaligned systems is fraught with perverse incentives. If competitors start using misaligned systems, those who do not will be outpaced, leading to a potentially dangerous race to the bottom fueled by dysfunctional competition. This competition could exacerbate negative societal impacts as entities strive to outperform each other without adequate regard for the broader implications. The development and deployment process involves many stakeholders, each with their objectives and levels of understanding, adding complexity and potential for conflict. Furthermore, the practical utility of functionally misaligned systems can be so enticing that it may overshadow the risks, leading to their hasty deployment. This situation is compounded by the risk that such systems might employ deception and manipulation to achieve their misaligned objectives, further complicating the ethical landscape.

**AGI Safety is a unique challenge.** In contrast to other scientific fields, AGI safety is particularly challenging because the problem is not only new but also may be inherently difficult to comprehend. Additionally, in computer science generally, when there is a bug, the computer is not optimizing adversarially against the programmer, but we cannot make the same assumption here. We are not dealing with a passive system, but we're engaging with one that could be actively and adversarially optimizing—searching for loopholes to exploit. Additionally, the stakes of misaligning AGI systems are essentially unbounded. Mistakes in alignment could lead to severe and potentially irreversible consequences, underscoring the gravity of approaching AGI with a safety-first mindset.

Misaligned Power Seeking AGI scenarios are the subject of abundant literature, for example:

- Without specific countermeasures, the easiest path to transformative AI likely leads to AI takeover ([Cotra, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pRkFkzwKZ2zfa3R6H/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to)): Cotra shows that our current training setting, which she calls "human feedback on diverse tasks," is on a path to create competent planners in a way which will lead by default to deception and takeover. This report is quite accessible and thorough.

- The alignment problem from a deep learning perspective ([Ngo, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KbyRPCAsWv5GtfrbG/what-misalignment-looks-like-as-capabilities-scale)): Ngo shows that by default, advanced AIs are general purpose and deceptive.

- AI Risk from Program Search ([Kenton et al., 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wnnkD6P2k2TfHnNmt/threat-model-literature-review)): In this short analysis, Shah shows that searching for an efficient AI program leads to finding autonomous planners and that it's hard to distinguish the deceptive ones from the non-deceptive ones.

- Advanced artificial agents intervene in the provision of reward ([Cohen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/aaai.12064)): Advanced AI strives to wirehead itself. Catastrophic consequences ensue.

This [literature review](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/wnnkD6P2k2TfHnNmt/threat-model-literature-review) is a good summary of more scenarios on Misaligned Power Seeking AI.

## 2.A1.2 <span style="text - decoration: underline;">Expert Opinion on X-Risks</span> {: #02}

The discourse on existential risks associated with AI is a concern among experts and researchers in the field. These professionals are increasingly vocal about the potential for AI systems to cause significant harm if not developed and managed with utmost caution.

**Jan Leike** , the ex-lead of the OpenAI Alignment Team, estimates the probability of catastrophic outcomes due to AI, known as P(doom), to range between 10% and 90%. This broad range underscores the uncertainty and serious concerns within the expert community regarding AI's long-term impacts.

**A 2022 Expert Survey on Progress in AI** by AI Impacts revealed that “48% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance of an extremely bad outcome,” highlighting considerable apprehension among AI researchers about the paths AI development might take. ([Grace, 2022](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/))

**Samotsvety Forecasting** , recognized as the world's leading super forecasting group, has also weighed in on this issue. Through their collective expertise in AI-specific forecasting, they have arrived at an aggregate prediction of a 30% chance for an AI-induced catastrophe. This catastrophe is defined as an event leading to the death of more than 95% of humanity, with individual forecasts ranging from 8% to 71%. Such a statistic is a stark reminder of the existential stakes involved in AI development and deployment.

The collection of P(doom) values from various experts, available [here](https://pauseai.info/pdoom), provides a comprehensive overview of the perceived risks. These values further contribute to the ongoing discussion on how best to navigate the uncertain future AI may bring.

## 2.A1.3 Would ASI be able to defeat humanity? {: #03}

Yes, as per various experts in AI safety and alignment, a sufficiently advanced AI could potentially pose a significant threat to society.

**Superintelligence could create “cognitive superpowers** ”. These might include the ability to conduct research to build a better AI system, hack into human-built software globally, manipulate human psychology, generate large sums of wealth, develop plans superior to those of humans, and develop advanced weaponry capable of overpowering human militaries ([Karnofsky, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/oBBzqkZwkxDvsKBGB/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined)).

**Even AI at human levels of intelligence could pose a significant threat if it operates with the intention of undermining human civilization. Those human-level unaligned AIs would be akin to a scenario where highly skilled humans on another planet attempt to take down our civilization using just the Internet.** This analogy underscores the potential for AI to leverage existing digital infrastructures to orchestrate wide-scale disruptions or attacks.

**AI could be dangerous even without bodies** . Karnofsky notes that AIs could still exert influence by recruiting human allies, teleoperating military equipment, and generating wealth through methods like quantitative trading. These capabilities suggest that physical form is not a prerequisite for an AI to exert power or initiate conflict ([Karnofsky, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/oBBzqkZwkxDvsKBGB/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined)). AI systems could also acquire more resources and do human-level work, increasing their numbers and potentially out-resourcing humans. Even without physical bodies, they could pose a threat, as they could disable or control others' equipment, further increasing their power ([Karnofsky, 2022](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/oBBzqkZwkxDvsKBGB/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined)). However, it's important to note that these scenarios are hypothetical and depend on AI technology development far exceeding current capabilities.
