**Foundation Model Paradigm.** The foundation model paradigm came about in the mid-to-late 2010s. The machine learning strategy shifted from using task-specific labeled datasets to using large, unlabeled datasets and creating more generalist models that can later be fine-tuned for specific needs. You can think of them as the Swiss army knives because they are capable of everything from language translation to generating artwork.

Advances in specialized hardware and parallelism (e.g., large clusters of NVIDIA GPUs), new developments in neural network architectures (e.g. transformers), and the increased easy access to vast amounts of online data all contributed to the paradigm of foundation models. Examples of foundation models are BERT, GPT, Claude, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, LLaMA, Gemini, and Mistral just to name a few.

We use the term frontier models to refer to a subset of foundation models that have cutting-edge state-of-the-art capabilities. Frontier models do not have to be foundation models, but they often are.

**Economics of Foundation Models.** The development and deployment of these models is still extremely resource-intensive, requiring significant investment in three main areas:

- **Data Acquisition**. Foundation models are trained on large-scale datasets, often sourced from the internet. Collecting, cleaning, and updating these datasets can be costly, especially for specialized or proprietary data.

- **Computational Resources**. The size of foundation models and their training datasets means that we need a lot of computational resources, including powerful hardware and electricity.

- **Research and Development**. Beyond immediate costs, we also need ongoing investment in research to develop new techniques and fine-tune existing models. This requires both financial resources and specialized expertise.

The next section provides a deeper dive into the core underlying techniques used in the development of these models.

## 1.2.1 Techniques & Training {: #01 }

**Overview**** of foundation model training**. The training process of foundation models begins with pre-training on large, diverse datasets. We use self-supervised learning to train on unlabeled data. Finally, fine-tuning adapts the model’s general knowledge to specific tasks.

**Pre-training.** This is the initial phase where the model is trained on a massive dataset of millions or billions of examples. During this phase, the model learns general patterns, structures, and knowledge.

**Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).** This is how we actually implement the pre-training. Unlike traditional supervised learning (SL) which relies heavily on labeled data, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) leverages unlabeled data, enabling models to learn from the inherent structure of the data itself.

For example, instead of manually labeling images, we might just hide part of a full image we already have and ask a model to predict what the rest should be. So it might predict the bottom half of an image given the top half, learning about which objects appear often together. It might learn for instance that images with trees and grass at the top often have more grass, or perhaps a path, at the bottom. It learns about objects and their context — trees and grass often appear in parks, dogs are often found in these environments, paths are usually horizontal, and so on. These learned representations can then be used for a wide variety of tasks that the model was not explicitly trained for, such as identifying dogs in images, or recognizing parks - all without any human-provided labels! In natural language processing, a model might predict the next word in a sentence, such as "The cat sat on the ____," learning grammar, syntax, and context as long as we repeat this over huge amounts of text.

**Zero & Few-Shot Learning.** These techniques enable models to perform tasks with very few examples. Zero-shot learning allows models to perform tasks without any specific examples, while few-shot learning enables them to generalize from a few examples. As an example, the model might learn to identify a new breed of dog after seeing just a few pictures, similar to how humans recognize new objects after just seeing them once or a few times.

**Transfer Learning.** We can now use our pre-trained model as a starting point for a new task or domain so that we don't have to start from scratch for every new task. The idea is to leverage the knowledge acquired by the pre-trained model from a large dataset and apply it to a related task with a smaller dataset. By doing so, we can benefit from the general features and patterns learned by the pre-trained model, saving time and computational resources. For example, a language model trained on general text data can be fine-tuned on legal documents to perform legal text analysis.

**Fine-Tuning.** Fine-tuning is one way that we can do transfer learning. In the fine-tuning phase, we adapt the model specifically to perform particular tasks. We use techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to further refine them to be more effective at specific things. As an example, a general-purpose language model like GPT-4 might be fine-tuned to improve its conversational abilities and follow instructions, giving us ChatGPT.

**Elicitation Techniques**. Lastly, we use prompts to point the model to use its abilities in even more specific context-relevant ways. Think of this as giving the model a final nudge in the right direction. The structure of the prompt can have a large effect on the overall performance we are able to get out of the system. We only briefly introduce the concept here. There are a variety of elicitation techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) that will be discussed in later chapters.

**Efficient use of resources**. Foundation models have the capacity to elevate their performance by leveraging additional data, more powerful computing resources, or advancements in model architecture. It's not merely a technique, but a pivotal attribute that dictates how well a model can adapt and expand its capabilities. As foundation models scale, they don't just grow; they become more nuanced, capable, and efficient in processing information, mirroring the enrichment of understanding and knowledge transfer. This makes scalability a crucial determinant in the operational efficacy of these models. We will discuss this capability further in the subsequent section on leveraging computation.

**Generalization**. This is the cornerstone of foundation models' effectiveness, enabling these AI systems to perform accurately on data they haven't previously encountered. This trait ensures the models remain versatile and reliable across various applications, making them indispensable tools in the AI toolkit. However, even though foundation models are displaying increasingly better generalization of capabilities, more research is needed to ensure the generalization of goals as well. The issue of capability generalization without goal generalization is something we will tackle in depth in subsequent chapters.

**Multi-modality**. This is a newer property that is still emerging as of 2024 but is expected to become extremely relevant as the years progresses. This opinion was reflected by Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI in a conversation with Bill Gates, where he mentioned "*Multimodality will definitely be important. Speech in, speech out, images, eventually video. Clearly, people really want that. Customizability and personalization will also be very important.*" ([source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/altman-multimodality-important-david-cronshaw-5fz0c))

We slightly touched on these capabilities in the section on state-of-the-art AI. This characterizes the capability of foundation models to process, interpret, and generate insights from various types of data, or "modalities," such as text, images, audio, and video. The power of multimodality in foundation models lies in its potential to create richer, more nuanced representations of information. By leveraging multiple forms of data, these models can establish deeper connections and uncover insights that might be missed when data types are considered in isolation. This can be considered similar to humans, where our comprehension of the environment is enhanced by integrating visual, auditory, and textual information, thereby offering a more holistic understanding of our surroundings.

## 1.2.3 Limitations & Risks {: #03 }

**Balancing Cost and Accessibility. **The development and training of foundation models require a significant investment, posing a delicate balance between cost and accessibility. While adapting an existing model for a specific task might be more cost-effective than developing a new one from scratch, potentially democratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities, the substantial initial costs risk centralizing power among a few well-resourced entities. This concentration of power can exacerbate existing inequalities, as only wealthy organizations or nations can afford to develop and deploy these advanced systems.

Additionally, there is an ongoing debate about whether these models should be open-sourced. Open sourcing can democratize access, allowing more people to benefit and contribute to advancements. However, it also increases the risk of misuse, as malicious actors could exploit these powerful tools for harmful purposes, such as generating deepfakes or coordinating cyberattacks. We talk more about these issues in the chapters on the risk landscape and AI governance.

**Homogenization**. The process of homogenization refers to the situation where an increasing number of AI systems are merely fine-tuned versions of the same foundation models. Therefore, if a foundation model has certain biases or failure modes, these could potentially be propagated to all models that are fine-tuned from this foundation. This is a significant risk because if the same problem exists in the foundation model, it could manifest across many different models and applications, leading to widespread and potentially correlated failures. For example, if a foundation model has been trained on data that has gender or racial biases, these biases could propagate to all models fine-tuned from it, leading to biased decisions across various applications, whether it be text generation, sentiment analysis, or even predictive policing.

**Emergence**. Increasing the centralization of general-purpose capabilities within a single model might result in unexpected and unexplainable behavior arising as a function of scale. This describes the phenomenon where foundation models exhibit complex behaviors or outputs not explicitly programmed, arising unpredictably from some underlying learned patterns. Emergent qualities rather than their explicit construction provide immense benefits, but this also makes foundation models hard to understand, predict, and control. This lack of predictability and control is a significant concern when these models are used in high-stakes domains. If they fail in ways that are outside our current understanding and expectations, these failures could be particularly problematic when combined with the homogenization described above. The same foundation model integrated into multiple critical functions could lead to correlated failures that span multiple critical functions or failsafes. This phenomenon of emergence is also talked about in more detail in subsequent sections.

We are only introducing the notion of emergence here, but we talk more about unexpected behavior due to scale in the section on scaling laws, as well as explore different arguments around emergence in the chapter on the landscape of AI risks.
