# 9.5 Critiques of Interpretability  {: #05 }
!!! note "Reading Time: 3 minutes" 

While interpretability offers potential value in understanding complex machine learning models, it faces several critical limitations that restrict its practical impact. Below are the main challenges that restrict interpretability’s usefulness in ensuring AI safety:

- **Limited practical use**: Interpretability tools and techniques rarely provide actionable insights for real-world applications, especially in industry.

- **Issues with Enumerative Safety: **Enumerative safety—the idea of analyzing every feature within a model to detect dangerous elements—faces inherent issues. High-level behaviors, not individual features, often drive risk. Focusing on isolated “risky” neurons or components can miss the broader capabilities that are more likely to cause harm.

- **Improved capabilities: **Although interpretability is intended to enhance safety, it can also unintentionally improve model performance in ways that might increase risk. For example, better insights into a model’s behavior can sometimes make it more capable without necessarily making it safer.

- **Alternative approaches can be more effective: **In many cases, tasks that interpretability aims to address, such as detecting and preventing undesirable behavior, are better achieved through other strategies, like evaluations, red-teaming, or fine-tuning.

Vocabulary

ACDC: Automatic Circuit DisCovery

activations: The outputs produced by neurons or units in a neural network after processing input data through a layer.

activation patching: A method used for understanding which components of a model are responsible for specific behaviors by replacing activations from one input with those from another and observing the impact on output.

activation steering: A technique for controlling a model’s output by modifying its activations during inference, directing the model toward desired outcomes without retraining.

channel: A channel refers to a dimension within a layer’s activations.

channels: Channels refer to a dimension within a layer’s activations.

circuit: Collection of neurons or components that work together to perform a specific function.

circuits: Collections of neurons or components that work together to perform specific functions

CNN: Convolutional Neural Network, a type of neural network primarily used for image classification, object detection, and pattern recognition.

CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks, a type of neural networks primarily used for image classification, object detection, and pattern recognition.

deceptively aligned model: A model that pretends to be aligned during training but engages in dangerous behavior during deployment. During training it acts helpful, honest and harmless, but in deployment it acts according to a dangerous secret goal.

feature: A specific pattern or characteristic that a neural network learns to detect, which may represent anything from low-level textures to high-level concepts.

feature map: A feature map is the output of a layer in a convolutional neural network.

feature maps: Feature maps are the output of a layer in a convolutional neural network.

monosemantic neurons: neurons that respond to just one specific feature or stimulus.

monosemantic neuron: neuron that responds to just one specific feature or stimulus.

polysemantic neurons: neuron that activates in response to a variety of distinct features.

polysemantic neurons: neurons that activate in response to a variety of distinct features.

polysemanticity: The empirical phenomenon where a single neuron or model component responds to multiple, unrelated features.

SAE: Sparse Autoencoder, a type of autoencoder designed to disentangle features that a model has learned.

SAEs: Sparse Autoencoders, a type of autoencoders designed to disentangle features that a model has learned.

Sparse Autoencoder: A type of autoencoder designed to disentangle features that a model has learned.

superposition hypothesis: The superposition hypothesis posits that neural networks efficiently store more features than they have neurons by encoding features as overlapping linear combinations across multiple neurons.

weights: The parameters of a neural network that determine the strength of the connection between neurons, learned during training to optimize the model’s performance.
