# Courses

Even though our book is still a work in progress, many courses and groups are already using these resources:

- [ML4Good Bootcamp](https://www.ml4good.org/) - A series of technical bootcamps designed to help people upskill in AI Safety.
- [Turing Seminar, an Introduction to AGI Safety](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/seminaire-turing/) - A university course run by Charbel at ENS Paris-Saclay, part of the MVA Master program.
- [AI Safety Collab Course](https://airtable.com/app2DRpMeeiBn1ci8/pagytLHlZ6Evhi2vP/form) - 80 participants used our course for the technical track of the AI Safety Collab.
- [AI Safety Gothenburg](https://www.facebook.com/aisafetygothenburg) - A local AI safety group that used our textbook.

If you want to use this resource for your group, don't hesitate to get in touch with us to receive a facilitation guide.
