              Our materials are widely adopted by dedicated AI Safety initiatives.
              <strong>ML4Good</strong> reaches approximately
              <strong>250 students annually</strong> across multiple countries, while
              <strong>AI Safety Collab</strong> runs cohorts of around
              <strong>80 students</strong> each. Local communities like AI Safety Gothenburg have
              adapted our content for their specific needs.
