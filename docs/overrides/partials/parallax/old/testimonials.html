              The unwritten rule of the digital transformation handbook is that you'll never have
              the resources to design experiences like Apple. But you can always close most
              usability gaps with an awesome documentation experience. Expressed similarly in
              <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/laws-simplicity">The Laws of Simplicity</a>,
              "Learning makes things simpler". Material for MkDocs is the magical, extensible, Open
              Source tool that makes sharing knowledge both easier and beautiful for both the
              writers and learners.

              One of the things people like the most about FastAPI, Typer, and SQLModel, is the
              documentation. I have put a lot of effort into making it easy to study and fast to
              understand. And a key component of that is the richness of ways I can explain and show
              things with Material for MkDocs. It's so easy to structure and explain things using it
              with all its features! It's simple to use, immersive for visitors, and beautiful by
              default.

              Hummingbot Foundation depends on Material for MkDocs for our official website and
              documentation at
              <a href="https://hummingbot.org">hummingbot.org</a>. We find it ideal for a complex
              documentation site because of the flexible navigation and layout options and built-in
              search.
