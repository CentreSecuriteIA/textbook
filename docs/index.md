# Overview

**What are we building?** The overarching project is to improve the AI safety education landscape. This means that we aim to do a couple of things:

- **Textbook**: First, the core of our project is writing a textbook that systematically maps the landscape of AI Safety knowledge. Rather than just aggregating existing content, we reconstruct key ideas into a carefully structured narrative where concepts build naturally on previous ones.

- **Course Materials**: Second, we also want to use the textbook as the foundation, around which we also develop course materials that help educators and learners engage with the writing effectively. We don't run courses ourselves, rather we hope to provide the best possible materials that others can use. We hope to provide things like videos, facilitation guides, and interactive learning to name just a few.

**Why does AI Safety need this project?** The field of AI Safety has grown significantly, yet its educational infrastructure hasn't kept pace. While there's abundant information available, it's scattered across forums, blogs, papers, and videos. This makes learning difficult, and demands significant effort to piece together concepts, and see how everything is connected to the larger safety infrastructure. Our project transforms this fragmented landscape into a coherent learning journey.

## Adoption

**Who currently uses this project?** Our materials have been adopted across three main categories of users:

- **AI Safety Programs**: Dedicated AI Safety initiatives have been among our earliest adopters. ML4Good, one of our largest implementations, reaches approximately 250 students annually across multiple countries. AI Safety Collab runs cohorts of around 80 students each, using our materials as their core curriculum. There are also self organized AI Safety groups like AI Safety Gothenburg that have adapted our content for their local communities. Generally, these programs seem to prefer the full technical track, as it helps prepare students for more advanced AI Safety work.
- **University Courses**: Some academic institutions have begun incorporating our materials into their formal curricula. ENS Ulm and ENS Paris-Saclay use our content to teach approximately 100 machine learning master's students annually. UBC's AI Safety program in Vancouver reaches 30-50 students per semester. We're seeing growing interest from other universities looking to establish AI Safety courses.
- **Independent Readers**: Beyond formal programs, our materials support numerous independent study groups and individual learners. We have recieved positive feedback from individual groups and readers in Moscow, Germany, Brazil and many other countries around the world.

    * “*I liked the text, was well written, concise, easy to follow, contained many important points.*” - Participant of ML4G Germany 2023.
    * “*The textbooks are very helpful to keep a clear line of thought and a better structure.*”  - Participant of ML4G France 2023.
    * “*The material and content are great, thank you for writing it and I can't wait to read it in its entirety.*” - Participant of ML4G France 2023.

**How can you use these materials?** Our resources are designed to be "plug and play" for different learning contexts. Whether you're running a university course, organizing a study group, or learning independently, we provide all the necessary resources. Course facilitators can access presentation materials, discussion frameworks, and assessment tools. This flexible design has allowed rapid adoption across various educational settings.
