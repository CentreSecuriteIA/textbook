![AI Safety](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XuuImYOYY7YElHDnooD6S7k1tf11JAV_a7LQZ6IUXbItUbPp0p7sAgDp1EjHJAuuHvZ_cJ-pj7rGq7SLxb0O4Xe9OkyRIEKh4R8TwoUwERq8TJxKRMQdixUPBjXXwVEjog_AqBgNiCwvE9QHEHlr_rk)

This textbook summarizes some key notions and papers in modern AI Safety, requiring minimal familiarity with the other materials covered. We tried to connect the various articles within a unified framework and coherent narrative.

The alignment problem is a pre-paradigmatic problem, and there is no consensus on some of the concepts presented. So please read critically and feel free to add feedback on this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-UI2pt99SHaH2RFPVbDdmo8nuiRBZcxl49rBh67Guj6_p5Q/viewform) on the various chapters if something seems unclear. Some weeks start with a gentle introduction, which you should follow if you are unfamiliar with the concepts.

This textbook is an adaptation of the [course](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/seminaire-turing/) held at ENS Paris-Saclay in Paris during March 2023, and offered by [EffiSciences](https://ia.effisciences.org/) and was used and appreciated during the [ML4Good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DkDy2hvkwbQ54GM9u/introducing-effisciences-ai-safety-unit-1) bootcamps in Paris and Germany.
