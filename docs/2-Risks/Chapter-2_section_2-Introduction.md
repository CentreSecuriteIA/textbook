# Introduction
We can't mitigate risks if we don't know their nature. This chapter aims to provide a solid overview of the various risks in the AI landscape.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent years, with capabilities expanding at an unprecedented pace. As these capabilities grow, so do the potential risks associated with AI systems. To effectively mitigate these risks, it is crucial to understand their nature and the factors that contribute to them.

**We begin by setting the context, examining the relationship between AI capabilities and risks.** As AI systems become more advanced, the potential for misuse, unintended consequences, and potentially catastrophic threats increases. It is essential to consider these risks in parallel with the development of AI technologies.

**To better understand the various types of risks, we propose a framework that categorizes them into three main groups: Misuses, Alignment, and Systemic ****r****isks.** Misuses refer to situations where an individual or group intentionally uses AI for harmful purposes. Alignment risks arise when AI systems pursue goals that are not aligned with human values, leading to unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences. Systemic Risks encompass broader issues that emerge from the complex interactions between AI, society, and the environment, where no single entity can be held fully responsible.

**Next, we explore specific AI capabilities that pose significant risks.** These include the potential for AI to be used in the development of[ ](https://www.example.com/bioweapons)[bioweapons](https://www.example.com/bioweapons) and[ ](https://www.example.com/cyber-offenses)[cyber offenses](https://www.example.com/cyber-offenses), as well as its capacity for[ ](https://www.example.com/deception)[deception and manipulation](https://www.example.com/deception). We also consider the risks associated with AI systems that exhibit agency,[ ](https://www.example.com/replication)[autonomous replication](https://www.example.com/replication), and advanced situational awareness. Understanding these capabilities is crucial for developing targeted risk mitigation strategies.

**Alignment risks are a central concern in AI safety, and we dedicate a section to exploring the factors that contribute to these risks.** We discuss the plausibility of goal-directed AI systems and the technical challenges involved in ensuring that their goals align with human values. The[ ](https://www.example.com/orthogonality)[orthogonality thesis](https://www.example.com/orthogonality) and[ ](https://www.example.com/convergence)[instrumental convergence](https://www.example.com/convergence) are introduced as key concepts that highlight the difficulty of creating naturally aligned AI.

**In addition to capability-specific risks and alignment challenges, several general factors can exacerbate risks across multiple categories.** These include the opaque nature of AI systems, which hinders our ability to monitor and control their behavior, and the massive scale at which AI can be deployed. Economic incentives that prioritize rapid development over safety considerations, the emergence of unforeseen capabilities, and the possibility of a rapid escalation in AI capabilities (known as a "fast takeoff") are also discussed as aggravating factors.

**The appendix delves into additional topics that bridge the gap between the various sources of risk and the potential for catastrophe.** We present a detailed scenario that illustrates how different risks can intersect and amplify one another. Expert opinions on existential risks posed by AI are also included, providing valuable insights from leading researchers in the field.

By understanding the nature and scope of these risks, we can develop more effective strategies for mitigating them and ensuring that the development of AI remains beneficial to humanity. The following chapters will build upon this foundation, exploring specific risk, technical solutions, and policy considerations in greater depth.
