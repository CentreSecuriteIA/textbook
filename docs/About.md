Currently, AI Safety courses rely heavily on a patchwork of many external links to blog posts and research papers (e.g. [AISF](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment?session=1)). This content varies in terms of technical depth and communication style, posing a significant barrier to coherent learning. We are writing a textbook that aims to unify these into a seamless narrative, to help improve the learning experience. We also want to include in our curriculum important considerations that are often neglected in other courses.

Our textbook is designed to serve as a comprehensive educational resource for the AI safety field. This will include an adaptation of the Turing Seminar, which is an accredited course with talks, workshops, and exercises at Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) Ulm, and ENS Paris-Saclay in France. The original syllabus for the seminar was loosely inspired by the AI Safety Fundamentals (AISF) curriculum that I teach at [Master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/seminaire-turing/).
