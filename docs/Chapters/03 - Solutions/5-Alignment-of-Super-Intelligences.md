# Alignment of Super Intelligences

Even if experts are uncertain whether creating an aligned human-level AI necessitates a paradigm shift, the consensus among AI safety researchers is that developing aligned superintelligences requires a specific solution, and likely a paradigm shift, due to several factors:

- **There is a strong likelihood that humans are not at the pinnacle of possible intelligence.** This acknowledgment implies that a superintelligence could possess cognitive abilities so advanced that aligning it with human values and intentions might be an insurmountable task, as our current understanding and methodologies may be inadequate to ensure its alignment. The cognitive difference between a super intelligence and a human could be akin to the difference between an ant and a human. Just as a human can easily break free from constraints an ant might imagine, a superintelligence could effortlessly surpass any safeguards we attempt to impose.

- **Deep learning offers minimal control and understanding over the model.** This method leads to the AI becoming a "black box," where its decision-making processes are opaque and not well-understood. Without significant advancements in interpretability, a superintelligence created only with deep learning would be opaque.

- **There is little margin for error, and the stakes are incredibly high**. A misaligned superintelligence could lead to catastrophic or even existential outcomes. The irreversible consequences of unleashing a misaligned superintelligence mean that we must approach its development with the utmost caution, ensuring that it aligns with our values and intentions without fail.

A last-chance strategy might be to write a letter imploring the AIs not to exterminate humans [[s](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/azRwPDbZfpadoL7WW/an-appeal-to-ai-superintelligence-reasons-to-preserve)], but we don't want to rely solely on that kind of strategy. Instead of relying on the superintelligence's compassion, here are some agendas that seem to be not entirely hopeless.

## Strategy D: Automating alignment research 

**We don't know how to align superintelligence, so we need to accelerate the alignment research with AIs. **OpenAI's “[Superalignment](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment)” plan is to accelerate alignment research with AI created by deep learning, slightly superior to humans in scientific research, and delegate the task of finding a plan for future AI. This strategy recognizes a critical fact: our current understanding of how to perfectly align AI systems with human values and intentions is incomplete. As a result, the plan suggests delegating this complex task to future AI systems. The primary aim of this strategy is to greatly speed up AI safety research and development [[16]](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research) by leveraging AIs that are able to think really, really fast. Some orders of magnitude of speed are given in the blog "[What will GPT-2030 look like?](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/what-will-gpt-2030-look-like/)". OpenAI's plan is not a plan but a meta plan.

**However, to execute this metaplan, we need a controllable and steerable automatic AI researcher. **OpenAI believes creating such an automatic researcher is easier than solving the full alignment problem. This plan can be divided into three main components[ ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/28sEs97ehEo8WZYb8/openai-s-alignment-plans)[[16]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/28sEs97ehEo8WZYb8/openai-s-alignment-plans):

1. **Training AI systems using human feedback, **i.e., creating a powerful assistant that follows human feedback, is very similar to the techniques used to "align" language models and chatbots. This could involve RLHF, for example.

2. **Training AI systems to assist human evaluation:** Unfortunately, RLHF is imperfect, partly because human feedback is imperfect. So, we need to develop AI that can help humans give accurate feedback. This is about developing AI systems that can aid humans in the evaluation process for arbitrarily difficult tasks. For example, if we need to judge the feasibility of an alignment plan proposed by an automatic researcher and give feedback on it, we have to be assisted to be able to do so easily. Yes, verification is generally easier than generation, but it is still very hard. Scalable Oversight would be necessary because imagine a future AI coming up with a thousand different alignment plans. How do you evaluate all those complex plans? That would be a very daunting task without AI assistance. See the chapter on scalable oversight for more details. 

3. **Training AI systems to do alignment research:**  The ultimate goal is to build language models capable of producing human-level alignment research. The output of these models could be natural language essays about alignment or code that directly implements experiments. In either case, human researchers would spend their time reviewing machine-generated alignment research[ ](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FTk7ufqK2D4dkdBDr/notes-on-openai-s-alignment-plan)[[14]](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FTk7ufqK2D4dkdBDr/notes-on-openai-s-alignment-plan). 

**Differentially accelerate alignment, not capabilities.** The aim is to develop and deploy AI research assistants in ways that maximize their impact on alignment research while minimizing their impact on accelerating AGI development[ ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FBG7AghvvP7fPYzkx/my-thoughts-on-openai-s-alignment-plan-1)[[15]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FBG7AghvvP7fPYzkx/my-thoughts-on-openai-s-alignment-plan-1). OpenAI has committed to openly sharing its alignment research when it's safe to do so, intending to be transparent about how well its alignment techniques work in practice[ ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/28sEs97ehEo8WZYb8/openai-s-alignment-plans)[[16]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/28sEs97ehEo8WZYb8/openai-s-alignment-plans).

**Cyborgism could enhance this plan.****[ ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism)**[Cyborgism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism) refers to the training of humans specialized in prompt engineering to guide language models so that they can perform alignment research. Specifically, they would focus on steering base models rather than RLHF-ed models. The reason is that language models can be very creative and are not goal-directed (and are not as dangerous as RLHF-ed goal-directed AIs). A human called a cyborg could achieve that goal by driving the non-goal-directed model. Goal-directed models could be useful but may be too dangerous. However, being able to control base models requires preparation, similar to the training required to drive a Formula One. The engine is powerful but difficult to steer. By combining human intellect and goal-directedness with the computational power and creativity of language-based models, cyborg researchers aim to generate more alignment research with future models. Notable contributions in this area include those by Janus and Nicolas Kees Dupuis [[s](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism)].

**There are various criticisms and concerns about OpenAI's ****superalignment**** plan** [[Akash](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FBG7AghvvP7fPYzkx/my-thoughts-on-openai-s-alignment-plan-1), [Zvi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NSZhadmoYdjRKNq6X/openai-launches-superalignment-taskforce), [Christiano](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Hna4aoMwr6Qx9rHBs/linkpost-introducing-superalignment?commentId=NsYXBdLY6edAXavsM), [MIRI](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tD9zEiHfkvakpnNam/a-challenge-for-agi-organizations-and-a-challenge-for-1), [Steiner](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pxiaLFjyr4WPmFdcm/take-2-building-tools-to-help-build-fai-is-a-legitimate), [Ladish](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6RC3BNopCtzKaTeR6/thoughts-on-the-openai-alignment-plan-will-ai-research)]. It should be noted, for example, that OpenAI's plan is very underspecified, and it is not impossible that some classes of risks were complete blindspots for OpenAI when they made the plan public. For example, in order for the superalignment plan to work, much of the technicalities explained in the article [The case for ensuring that powerful AIs are controlled](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kcKrE9mzEHrdqtDpE/the-case-for-ensuring-that-powerful-ais-are-controlled#) were not explained by OpenAI but discovered one year later by Redwood Research, another organization. It is very likely that many other blindspots remain. However, we would like to emphasize that it is better to have a public plan than no plan at all and that it is possible to justify the plan in broad terms [[Leike](https://aligned.substack.com/p/alignment-optimism), [Bogdan](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FtHidqjAFTerfMZLo/aisc-project-how-promising-is-automating-alignment-research)].

## Strategy E: Safe by Design Systems

**Current deep networks, such as GPT4, are impressive but still have many failure modes** [[model technical specifications](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf)] **that may be unpatchable**. Theoretical arguments suggest that these increasingly powerful models are more likely to have alignment problems ([Turner et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683)), to the point where it seems that the current paradigm of monolithic models is destined to be insecure ([El-Mhamdi et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15259)). All of this justifies the search for a new, more secure paradigm. 

**Safe-by-design AI may be necessary.** Given that the current deep learning paradigm notoriously makes it hard to develop explainable and trustworthy models, it seems worth exploring approaches to create models that are more explainable and steerable by design, built on well-understood components and rigorous foundations.

There are not many agendas that try to provide an end-to-end solution to alignment, but here are some of them.

- [Open Agency Architecture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pKSmEkSQJsCSTK6nH/an-open-agency-architecture-for-safe-transformative-ai), by Davidad. Basically, create a highly realistic simulation of the world using future LLM that would code it. Then, define some security constraints that apply to this simulation. Then, train an AI on that simulation and use formal verification to make sure that the AI never does bad things. This proposal may seem extreme because creating a detailed simulation of the world is not easy, but this plan is very detailed and, if it works, would be a true solution to alignment and could be a real alternative to simply scaling LLMs. More information on this proposal is available in the appendix. Davidad is leading a program in ARIA to try to scale this research.

- [Provably safe systems: the only path to controllable AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01933) from Max Tegmark and  Steve Omohundro. The plan puts mathematical proofs as the cornerstone of safety. An AI would need to be a Proof-Carrying Code, which means that it would need to be something like a PPL (and not just some deep learning). This proposal aims to make not only the AI but also the whole infrastructure safe, for example, by designing GPUs that can only execute proven programs. 

Other proposals for a safe-by-design system include [The Learning-Theoretic Agenda](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZwshvqiqCvXPsZEct/the-learning-theoretic-agenda-status-2023), from Vanessa Kossoy, and [the QACI alignment plan](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4RrLiboiGGKfsanMF/the-qaci-alignment-plan-table-of-contents) from Tamsin Leake. The CoEm proposal from Conjecture could also be in this category. 

Unfortunately, all of these plans are far from complete today.

**These plans are safety agendas with relaxed constraints**, i.e., they allow the AGI developer to incur a substantial alignment tax. Designers of AI safety agendas are cautious about not increasing the alignment tax to ensure labs implement these safety measures. However, the agendas from this section accept a higher alignment tax. For example, CoEm represents a paradigm shift in creating advanced AI systems, assuming you're in control of the creation process.

**These plans would require international cooperation.** For example, Davidad’s plan also includes a governance model that relies on international collaboration. You can also read the post “[Davidad's Bold Plan for Alignment: An In-Depth Explanation — LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jRf4WENQnhssCb6mJ/davidad-s-bold-plan-for-alignment-an-in-depth-explanation#High_Level_Hopes),” which details more high-level hopes. Another perspective can be found in Alexandre Variengien’s[ ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sTiKDfgFBvYyZYuiE/)[post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sTiKDfgFBvYyZYuiE/), detailing Conjecture's vision, with one very positive externality being a change in narrative.

*“We dream of a world where we launch aligned AIs as we have launched the International Space Station or the James Webb Space Telescope”** – from **[Davidad's Bold Plan for Alignment: An In-Depth Explanation — LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jRf4WENQnhssCb6mJ/davidad-s-bold-plan-for-alignment-an-in-depth-explanation#High_Level_Hopes)*.

## Strategy F:  World Coordination

**Enhanced global coordination on AI development.** To ensure that the advancement of AI benefits society as a whole, it's imperative to establish a global consensus on mitigating extreme risks associated with AI models. We should coordinate to avoid creating models with extreme risks until there is a consensus on how to mitigate these risks.

**The trade-off between creating superhuman intelligence now or later. **Of course, we can aim to develop an ASI ASAP. This could potentially solve cancer, cardiovascular diseases associated with aging, and even the problems of climate change. Maybe. The question is whether it's beneficial to aim to construct an ASI in *this* next decade, especially when the co-head of the alignment team, Jan Leike, suggests that the probability of doom is between 10 and 90%. It could be better to wait a few years so that the probability of failure drops to more reasonable numbers. It's important to make this trade-off public and to make a democratic and transparent choice.

**Instead of building ASIs, we could focus on the development of specialized, non-agentic AI systems for beneficial applications** such as [medical research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02640-w), [weather forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12794), and [materials science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9). These specialized AI systems can significantly advance their respective domains without the risks associated with creating highly advanced, autonomous AI. For instance, Alpha Geometry is capable of reaching the Gold level at the International Mathematical Olympiads. By prioritizing non-agentic models, we can harness the precision and efficiency of AI while avoiding the most dangerous failure modes.

**The myth of inevitability.** The narrative that humanity is destined to pursue overwhelmingly powerful AI can be deconstructed. History shows us that humanity can choose not to pursue certain technologies, such as human cloning, based on ethical considerations. A similar democratic decision-making process can be applied to AI development. By actively choosing to avoid the riskiest applications and limiting the deployment of AI in high-stakes scenarios, we can navigate the future of AI development more responsibly. This approach emphasizes precaution, ethical responsibility, and collective well-being, steering clear of the metaphorical "playing with fire" in AI advancements. This is what we call the myth of inevitability.

*The likely result of humanity facing down an opposed superhuman intelligence is a total loss. Valid metaphors include “a 10-year-old trying to play chess against Stockfish 15”, “the 11th century trying to fight the 21st century,” and “Australopithecus trying to fight Homo sapiens“.*

- [Pausing AI Developments Isn’t Enough. We Need to Shut it All Down](https://intelligence.org/2023/04/07/pausing-ai-developments-isnt-enough-we-need-to-shut-it-all-down/), by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

| “Shut it all down” - Eliezer Yudkovsky |
|---|
| The "shut it all down" position, as advocated by Eliezer Yudkowsky, asserts that all advancements in AI research should be halted due to the enormous risks these technologies may pose if not appropriately aligned with human values and safety measures [8].
According to Yudkowsky, the development of advanced AI, especially AGI, can lead to a catastrophic scenario if adequate safety precautions are not in place. Many researchers are aware of this potential catastrophe but feel powerless to stop the forward momentum due to a perceived inability to act unilaterally.
The policy proposal entails shutting down all large GPU clusters and training runs, which are the backbones of powerful AI development. It also suggests putting a limit on the computing power anyone can use to train an AI system and gradually lowering this ceiling to compensate for more efficient training algorithms.
The position argues that it is crucial to avoid a race condition where different parties try to build AGI as quickly as possible without proper safety mechanisms. This is because once AGI is developed, it may be uncontrollable and could lead to drastic and potentially devastating changes in the world.
He says there should be no exceptions to this shutdown, including for governments or militaries. The idea is that the U.S., for example, should lead this initiative not to gain an advantage but to prevent the development of a dangerous technology that could have catastrophic consequences for everyone.
It's important to note that this view is far from consensual, but the "shut it all down" position underscores the need for extreme caution and thorough consideration of potential risks in the field of AI. |
