# Appendix 1: Expert Opinions

??? question "Why is this section important?"

     We do not think this section is that important. The author of this textbook encourages you to think for yourself. But this is at least informative.

## Surveys

According to a recent survey conducted by AI Impact ([source](https://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thousands_of_AI_authors_on_the_future_of_AI.pdf)): *“****Expected time to human-level performance dropped 1–5 decades since the 2022 survey****. As always, our questions about ‘high-level machine intelligence’ (HLMI) and ‘full automation of labor’ (FAOL) got very different answers, and individuals disagreed a lot (shown as thin lines below), but the aggregate forecasts for both sets of questions dropped sharply. For context, between 2016 and 2022 surveys, the forecast for HLMI had only shifted about a year.”*

It is also possible to compare the predictions of the same study in 2022 to the current results. It is interesting to note that the community has generally underestimated the speed of progress over the year 2023 and has adjusted its predictions downward. Some predictions are quite surprising. For example, tasks like "Write High School Essay" and "Transcribe Speech" are arguably already automated with ChatGPT and Whisper, respectively. However, it appears that researchers are not aware of these results. Additionally, it is surprising that “AI researcher” has longer timelines than “High-level machine intelligence (all human tasks)”.

The median of the most recent expert survey predicts human-level machine intelligence (HLMI) in 2049.

## Expert Quotes

Here are some quotes from experts regarding transformative AI:

- **Geoffrey Hinton**: "Until quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20 to 50 years before we have general purpose AI," Hinton said. "And now I think it may be 20 years or less." ([source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/godfather-of-artificial-intelligence-weighs-in-on-the-past-and-potential-of-artificial-intelligence/))

- **Yoshua Bengio**: Leading expert in AI, Yoshua Bengio: "...it started to dawn on me that my previous estimates of when human-level AI would be reached needed to be radically changed. Instead of decades to centuries, I now see it as 5 to 20 years with 90%." ([source](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/08/12/personal-and-psychological-dimensions-of-ai-researchers-confronting-ai-catastrophic-risks/))

- **Yann LeCun**: “By "not any time soon", I mean "clearly not in the next 5 years", contrary to a number of folks in the AI industry.” ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/03/meta-ai-chief-yann-lecun-skeptical-about-agi-quantum-computing.html))

- **Ilya Sutskever**: "You're gonna see dramatically more intelligent systems in 10 or 15 years from now, and I think it's highly likely that those systems will have a completely astronomical impact on society" ([source](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/kxgg1b/openais_chief_scientist_ilya_sutskever_comments/))

- **Demis Hassabis:** “We could only be a few years, maybe a decade away” ([source](https://www.wsj.com/video/events/the-race-for-true-ai-at-google/7953FE4B-AE84-4AFA-9722-AA215EB357EE.html))

Note that Hinton, Bengio, and Sutskever are the 3 most cited researchers in the field of AI. And that Hinton, Bengio, and LeCun are the recipients of the Turing Award in Deep Learning. Some users on reddit have put together a comprehensive list of publicly stated AI timelines forecasts from famous researchers and industry leaders. The full list can be found at [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/18vawje/comment/kfpntso/).

## Prediction Markets

A prediction market, such as [manifold](https://manifold.markets/home) market, allows users to bet on future events, for example the result of a national election, or the release date of a particular product. Prediction markets are one of the best probabilistic crystal balls we currently have, and they are, in general, better tools than surveys or experts. An article on the prediction of the reproducibility of scientific articles compared these prediction methods, and it was found that prediction markets outperformed expert surveys ([source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1516179112)). The argument is that either prediction markets are more accurate than experts, or experts should be able to make a lot of money from these markets and, in doing so, correct the markets. As of January 2024, in response to the question “When will the first weakly general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced?”, the Metaculus market predicts currently a median year of 2026 ([source](https://www.notion.so/Economic-foresight-from-the-perspective-of-AI-development-8e2cf5c63f1748af85fa25e37fd5bc22?pvs=21)), and for the question “When will the first general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced?”Metaculus predicts currently a median of 2031. ([source](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/)).
