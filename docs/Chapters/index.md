# **The Handbook** of **AI Safety**

<h2 align="left">A comprehensive guide</h2>

![AI Safety](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XuuImYOYY7YElHDnooD6S7k1tf11JAV_a7LQZ6IUXbItUbPp0p7sAgDp1EjHJAuuHvZ_cJ-pj7rGq7SLxb0O4Xe9OkyRIEKh4R8TwoUwERq8TJxKRMQdixUPBjXXwVEjog_AqBgNiCwvE9QHEHlr_rk)

This textbook summarizes some key notions and papers in modern AI Safety, requiring minimal familiarity with the other materials covered. We tried to connect the various articles within a unified framework and coherent narrative.

The alignment problem is a pre-paradigmatic problem, and there is no consensus on some of the concepts presented. So please read critically and feel free to add feedback on this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-UI2pt99SHaH2RFPVbDdmo8nuiRBZcxl49rBh67Guj6_p5Q/viewform) on the various chapters if something seems unclear. Some weeks start with a gentle introduction, which you should follow if you are unfamiliar with the concepts.

This textbook is an adaptation of the [course](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/seminaire-turing/) held at ENS Paris-Saclay in Paris during March 2023, and offered by [EffiSciences](https://ia.effisciences.org/) and was used and appreciated during the [ML4Good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DkDy2hvkwbQ54GM9u/introducing-effisciences-ai-safety-unit-1) bootcamps in Paris and Germany.

## **Curriculum**

The textbook is currently written as a list of chapters. Some chapters contain a list of quizzes on key resources. Reading carefully each chapter of the textbook should take 1-2 hours.

### **PART 1 : FUNDAMENTALS**

!!! info ""
    We encourage all readers, including those without a technical background, to read through Chapters 1, 2, and 3. These chapters explain in an accessible way why it is plausible to see the emergence of human-level AI in the next few years, what are the potential risks associated with these advanced AIs, and what solutions can be put in place to mitigate these risks. These introductory chapters aim to provide a solid foundation for understanding the issues and challenges of AI Safety.

### **PART 2 : TECHNICAL PROBLEMS**

!!! info ""
    In this part, we dive into the specific technical challenges of AI alignment. We start with the problem of Reward Misspecification, which occurs when the reward function given to an AI agent fails to properly capture the intended goals. We explore key concepts such as optimization, Goodhart's Law, and different approaches to learning human preferences, such as learning by imitation and feedback.

    Next, we address the problem of Goal Misgeneralization, where an AI agent may learn unintended goals that differ from those intended by its designers. We examine important concepts such as mesa-optimization, inner alignment, and deceptive alignment. This part aims to provide a deep understanding of the main technical challenges in AI alignment and sets the stage for exploring research paradigms in the next part.

### **PART 3 : RESEARCH PARADIGMS**

!!! info ""
    In this part, we explore the main research paradigms proposed to address the challenges of AI alignment. We start with task decomposition techniques for Scalable Oversight, such as iterated amplification and process supervision. Next, we examine adversarial techniques for Scalable Oversight, including debate and adversarial training. We dedicate an entire chapter to interpretability, covering both interpretability techniques for computer vision and transformers used in natural language processing. We also delve into Agent Foundations and examine more theoretical research paradigms. Finally, we also give an overview of AI Governance.

    This part aims to give readers an overview of the main research approaches in the field of AI alignment and inspire them to contribute to this crucial domain.
