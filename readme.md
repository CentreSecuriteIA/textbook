# Readme

The number one rule of this repo is that we do not modify the content in here but directly on gdoc.

The content is automatically generated from the drive.

Each time you significantly change the gdoc, you can just run a command (update.py) to update the repo.

Develop locally, usse the command:
mkdocs serve
